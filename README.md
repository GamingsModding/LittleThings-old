#LittleThings
A minecraft mod which adds things designed to enhance the vanilla survival experience

## A huge thank you to:
1. Pahimar for his Lets Mod Reboot series and getting me interested in making my own mods. 
2. Bedrockminer for helpful code with everything.
3. HCGamingMC for testing the mod and showcasing the latest versions.

## Testing:
At the moment the mod is restricted to a closed alpha group. As soon as I believe that the mod is ready I will release the mod to open beta.

## NB
If you have any ideas for what to put into this mod, please go to the issues tab and put it there.
