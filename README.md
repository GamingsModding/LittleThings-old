#LittleThings
A minecraft mod which adds things...

## A huge thank you to:
1. Pahimar for his Lets Mod Reboot series and getting me interested in making my own mods. 
2. Bedrockminer for helpful code with everything.

## Testing:
At the moment the mod is restricted to a closed alpha group. As soon as I believe that the mod is ready I will release the mod to open beta.
