#LittleThings
A minecraft mod which adds things designed to enhance the vanilla survival experience

## A huge thank you to:
1. Pahimar for his Lets Mod Reboot series and getting me interested in making my own mods. 
2. Bedrockminer for helpful code with everything.

## Testing:
At the moment the mod is restricted to a closed alpha group. As soon as I believe that the mod is ready I will release the mod to open beta.

## NB
Please contact HardcoreGamingMC or RageGamingPE if you have any ideas you want us to evaluate and put in the mod.
